/*
 *  RawMovementTracker.h
 *
 *  The Raw Movement Tracker tracks the robot�s movement by geometrically
 *  interpreting the sensor data sent back from the robot. This method
 *  remains accurate (at least as accurate as the sensor data) as long as
 *  the robot�s movement is linear, meaning that the wheels were not
 *  differentially driven. When a differential steering system is made
 *  use of, the accuracy of the tracker declines as the sensor interval
 *  increases.
